📊 Customer Shopping Behavior – End-to-End Data Analytics Project
🔍 Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution that analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover actionable business insights.
It demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into clean data, analytical insights, SQL-driven answers, and interactive dashboards.
The project follows a real corporate analytics workflow, combining Python, SQL, and Power BI.

📁 Dataset
File: cleaned_customer_shopping_behavior.csv
Type: Customer transaction & behavior data
Key Attributes:
Item purchased
Purchase amount
Review rating
Discount applied
Customer behavior metrics
The dataset was cleaned and standardized using Python before analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning & exploratory analysis
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server compatible) – Business queries
Power BI – Interactive dashboard & visualization
Jupyter / Python Script – Data processing (app.py)

⚙️ Project Workflow
Load raw dataset into Python
Clean and preprocess data using Pandas
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Store cleaned data for SQL analysis
Write SQL queries to answer business questions
Build Power BI dashboard for stakeholders

🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing
Performed using Python (Pandas):
Removed missing and invalid values
Standardized text fields (Yes/No, categories)
Converted numeric fields and ratings
Created a clean, analysis-ready dataset

📄 Script: app.py
📄 Output: cleaned_customer_shopping_behavior.csv

🗄️ SQL Analysis
SQL queries were written to answer real business questions such as:
Products with highest discount dependency
Relationship between discounts and customer ratings
Purchase behavior trends
Product performance insights

📄 SQL File: project.sql

Key SQL concepts used:
Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
GROUP BY, HAVING
Subqueries
Conditional logic (CASE WHEN)

📈 Power BI Dashboard

📊 Customer Behavior Dashboard (Customer Behavior Dashboard.pbix)

Dashboard includes:
KPI cards (Total Purchases, Avg Rating, Discount %)
Top products by discount usage
Purchase trends and comparisons
Interactive filters for business users
The dashboard is designed to be executive-friendly and insight-driven.

📊 Results & Insights
Identified products highly dependent on discounts
Highlighted customer preference patterns
Found relationships between discounts and ratings
Provided data-backed recommendations for pricing and promotions
